# SimplePreloader
This package has been created to demonstrate the creation of a simple preloader for HTTP Requests.

### Coding Standards and Conventions
* **Add a blank line before return statements**, unless the return is alone inside a statement-group
* **Always use identical comparison** unless you need type juggling
* **Use Yoda conditions** when checking a variable against an expression to avoid an accidental assignment
* **Use braces to indicate control structure body** regardless of the number of statements it contains
* Naming Conventions
  * Variables: **variableName**
  * Properties: **propertyName**
  * Methods/Functions: **functionName()**
